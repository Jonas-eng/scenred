## Scenario reduction algorithms for stochastic programming.

Python implementation of the simultaneous backward reduction and fast forward selection scenario reduction techniques for stochastic programming. The algorithms itself are implemented in optimized cython code, which translates to C-code, for fast execution.
The algrotihms are described in [1]
